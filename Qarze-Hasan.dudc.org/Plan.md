##  Qarze hasana Website Update


**why  I want to update Website, though it is working.** 

As I made it before 2024, that time i was make it not fully automatted. many of the task need to do by volunteer. I want make it more ifficient feasible easy to use. the problem i will solve that is:

* [ ] Now member registration process is very hard. they did not confirmed by email. Expectation: In registration system if someone sign up autometically volunteer get notification and aprove form then autometically get approved email.
* [ ] User Dashboard: where students/volunteer can see user loan history. her behaviour for  loan.
* [ ] analytical dashboard: where volunteer and management team can see that how many money in field. how many money i can provide for now everything
* [ ] Payment getway intigration
* [ ] **Automated Reminder System**
* [ ] **Help & Support Section**
* [ ] **Success Stories/Testimonials**
* [ ] **Advanced Reporting Tools**
* [ ] **Public Impact Dashboard**
* [ ] Donation transperecy: if sumone donate in a table shows that we recived donation in
* [ ] Money tracker. let say our balance is 100k now then if someone donate it will be 103k then suppose someone take loan then deducted . like bank statment show



1. colour combination is not good. specially i dont like Warm Gold select a colour plate that is eye soothing and high contrast.
2. Add islamic vibe.
